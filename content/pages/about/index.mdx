👋🏽 Hey! This is me.

I am a 20-year-old 💻Engineer who turned into a 📱Product Enthusiast. I love to talk about Marketing, Design & Products.


If you don't know me, it might help to introduce myself by way of three role models of mine: Kunal Shah who drives my curiosity, Steve Jobs who anchors my vision and Naval Ravikant who drives my wisdom. They bring together some of my core values!

🚀 Goals : I'm passionate about people, the problems they face, and the products that can solve them. I'm interested in technology, education, and entrepreneurship because of their ability to create scalable, sustainable impact.
