# Ayo! 👋🏻
I am Abhinav - A third year computer science undergrad at NIIT University.  I work on Ideas that shift paradigms.

I am always intersted in Products and Marketing. I love helping startups and brands in growth 🚀

I have a belief that Product and Marketing are two sides of same coin. They work hand in hand. None can exist in isolation to each other.

I have previously founded [Chunkin Media](https://chunkinmedia.com) 

Now apart from work, I spend my time experimenting with ideas, [reading](https://heyabhinav.com/reading), [writing](https://heyabhinav.com/blog) and [tweeting](https://twitter.com/abhnvx).

My Playground:
Product Management | Brand Building | Marketing | Growth Hacking | UI/UX Design | Startups

My Beliefs:
- Experiment, Reflect and Iterate.
- Curiosity is the mother of everything.

Love to explore new cultures and traditions in my free time!
Hit me up, let's grab a coffee and let's vibe!
